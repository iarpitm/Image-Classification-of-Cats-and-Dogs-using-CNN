In this project, I implemented an image classification model to distinguish between cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras. The workflow included:

Data Preprocessing: Normalization and image augmentation to improve generalization.

Model Architecture: A sequential CNN with convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.

Training: Optimized with Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy loss, and evaluated using training/validation splits.

Results: The model achieved strong accuracy on validation data, showing effective feature extraction for binary image classification.
